       <br><p>Dear Ms. Smith,</p></br>

        <p align="center"><b>SUMMARY OF MY FIRST DAY IN SQI</b></p>
       </div>
       <p align="justify">I am writing to tell you how happy I am to be part of SQI. The first day I came to SQI, I was a bit anxious of what I would face because of how people explained tech would be. I tried as much as possible to keep an open mind to embrace the journey. As a first timer, I was shy and kept my cool. I observed the environment and how things are being done in order not to flop. Some of the tutors are young so I found it hard to create a tutor-student relationship with them because I didn't know how to regard them  but as time goes on, I had to put that aside and accept the fact that I'm a student. In order to learn and achieve my aim, I have to be humble and submissive.

        We started with HTML. The word HTML sounded familiar to me and I guessed I heard it first when I was in a computer class in school.</p>
        
        <p>It's indeed a wonderful experience to be a student in SQI because of the tutor's accessibility and rapt attention to student's cooperation. They always make sure the students are carried along.</p>
        <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
        <p>Nnamdi Esther.</p>
